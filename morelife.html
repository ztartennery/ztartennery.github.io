        <blockquote>
            <q>Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need. We're the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War's a spiritual war... our Great Depression is our lives. We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very pissed off.</q>
            <br> &mdash; Fight Club</blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <q>Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius â€” and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction.</q>
            <br> &mdash; Ernst F. Schumacher</blockquote>
